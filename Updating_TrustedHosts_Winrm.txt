
Can't enable PSRemoting?

Assuming that the host you want to start trusting (and connect to) is giving you an IP address of 169.254.213.130, you add it like this:


winrm set winrm/config/client '@{TrustedHosts="[169.254.213.130]"}'

BEWARE of those weird clipboard symbol interpretation issues with Windows - a better bet 
is to type into the shell manually instead of copying and pasting.


Now, check your work:

---------------------------------------------------
winrm get winrm/config/client

Client
    NetworkDelayms = 5000
    URLPrefix = wsman
    AllowUnencrypted = false
    Auth
        Basic = true
        Digest = true
        Kerberos = true
        Negotiate = true
        Certificate = true
        CredSSP = false
    DefaultPorts
        HTTP = 5985
        HTTPS = 5986
    TrustedHosts = [169.254.213.130]
    
    -----------------------------------------------
    
   
 
 Also you might need to do this:
 winrm set winrm/config/client '@{AllowUnencrypted="true"}'
 
 
 
 However, when you run: 
 
 Enter-PSSession -computerName <name-of-server>  
 
 ...you get this error:
 
 WinRM already is set up to receive requests on this machine.
 Set-WSManQuickConfig : WinRM firewall exception will not work since one of the network connection types on this machine
  is set to Public. Change the network connection type to either Domain or Private and try again.

    TO FIX THIS:
    
    Open Windows Poweshell ISE and copy the following crap into the IDE.  
    Execute the commands by hittint F5 or File > Run.
    
    Nothing will appear to happen, that's normal.
    
    Save as a script called SetConnectionToBePrivate.ps1 and stash it somewhere, then exit the IDE.
    
    Now, enter the following in Powershell - notice that you get all the way through the dialog now:
    
    
    -------------------------------------------
    PS C:\> Enable-PSRemoting
    
    WinRM Quick Configuration
    Running command "Set-WSManQuickConfig" to enable this machine for remote management through WinRM service.
     This includes:
        1. Starting or restarting (if already started) the WinRM service
        2. Setting the WinRM service type to auto start
        3. Creating a listener to accept requests on any IP address
        4. Enabling firewall exception for WS-Management traffic (for http only).
